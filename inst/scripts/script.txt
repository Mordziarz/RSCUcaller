This document describes the methods used to generate the sequence data stored in the inst/extdata directory, including both manual and programmatic approaches.

Summary
The sequence data was retrieved from NCBI GenBank using batch retrieval methods. Two sets of sequences were downloaded: a smaller set of 4 accession numbers and a larger set of 23 accession numbers. All sequences were downloaded in FASTA nucleotide format, focusing on coding sequences (CDS).

Batch 1: Small Set of Sequences

1. Accessed the NCBI Batch Entrez system at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez

2. Created a text file containing the following accession numbers:

OQ280817
OL654070
OQ280824
OQ280829

3. Uploaded the file to the Batch Entrez system

4. Clicked "Retrieve" followed by "Retrieve records for 4 UID(s)"

5. Selected each sequence individually

6. Clicked "Send to" → "Coding Sequences"

7. Selected Format "FASTA Nucleotide"

8. Clicked "Create File" to download the coding sequences

Batch 2: Larger Set of Sequences

1. Created a text file containing the following accession numbers:

OQ236459
OQ236457
OQ236460
OQ236458
OQ236455
OQ236456
